 

My Android app displays the meal suggestion of the day engaging with users to interact with it. The app is developed using Kotlin and Android Studio. 

The code structure of the app considers MainActivity handles users input and updates the UI. 

Layout /Activity_main.xml defines the UI layout for the main activity. 

 

Therefore, the app launches  MainActivity.kt , which fills the Text display like written in my application with menu items. So that when the user clicks on the Time of the (e.g. morning, mid-morning, afternoon, ext).  MainActivity.kt handles the click event and updates the UI accordingly. 

 

Button Click Event  

Submit Button: when the “button” is clicked it recreates an order by displaying a toast message with the selected menu item name. For the submit button if you entered the wrong time of day, it would display a message that says “Error kindly enters the correct time of day (morning, mid-morning, afternoon, dinner). Reset Button: when the “reset button” is clicked the menu will display a message that says, “please enter menu”.
